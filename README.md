## Introduction
ECSE 275 introduced a variety of concepts covering a wide range of applications. Among these, what intrigued our group the most was the study of differential robots and their path planning. Mobile robots have numerous applications, particularly in autonomously planning their journeys to reach a destination. This motivated us to delve deeper and explore how we could expand on these ideas.  
As a result, we decided to implement multiple differential robots operating simultaneously. Additionally, we integrated visual servoing into the path-planning process, enabling the robots to perform more complex tasks, such as identifying secondary goal points that are unknown at the start of their journey.  
By combining these steps, we aimed to create a system of three differential robots capable of navigating toward their primary goals, discovering unknown secondary goal points using visual servoing, and avoiding collisions with obstacles and each other. Each robot would be given a color, red, green, and blue, so they can find their respective secondary goals that are red, green, or blue.
